\begin{abstract}
Decentralized finance has emerged to be a relevant player in the crypto world.
In this field, stablecoins are an important tool to avoid asset price fluctuations as best as possible thus generating stable yields for investors.
Recently, especially decentralized algorithmic stablecoins have gained popularity in the community.
However, their drawback is based on missing price stability due to the lack of asset liquidity.
Such low liquidity rates could lead to market manipulation, long peg rebalancing times, and potential losses for the end-user.
The \aphra engine tackles this problem by providing a programmable way to offer liquidity to stablecoin projects.
This engine consists of a continuous integration platform facilitating workflow development that can be used to balance stablecoin pegs.
Project-owned liquidity applied for peg equilibration is generated from cashflow-generating assets that are fed back into our ecosystem to ensure long-term liquidity.
The engine is managed through a decentralized autonomous organisation and governance is obtained by ownership of the vote-escrowed \aphra governance token.
Our engine provides a solution to an important problem within the decentralized finance space, enabling its sustainable upscaling, and thus greater adoption in the near future.
